# React 16 Essentials - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [React 16 Essentials - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/react-16-essentials-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787126046), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
React 16 Essentials, Second Edition, fully updated for React 16, takes you on a fast-paced journey through building your own maintainable React 16 applications. React experts Artemij Fedosejev and Adam Boduch give you all the essentials you need to know and start working with React 16, in this new edition of the best-selling React.js Essentials title. You'll find the latest React 16 code updates, assessment of React Fiber, new coverage of Redux, and how to work as a modern React developer.

The authors offer you their current assessment of React Fiber, and you'll soon be exploring React 16 hands on, creating your own single and multiple user interface elements with React 16. You'll then see how to create stateless and stateful components and make them reactive. You'll also learn to interact between your components and lifecycle methods, and gauge how to effectively integrate your user interface components with other JavaScript libraries. Delve deep into the core elements of the Redux architecture and learn how to manage your application and data persistence. Then go the extra mile with the Jest test framework, and run multiple tests on your applications and find solutions to scale without complexity.

Today React is used by Facebook, Instagram, Khan Academy, and Imperial College London, to name a few. Many new users recognize the benefits of React and adopt it in their own projects, forming a fast-growing community. The speed at which React has evolved promises a bright future for anyone who invests in learning it today. Let Artemij and Adam bring you a brand new look at React 16 and React Fiber, and move your web development into the future.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
const reactElement = React.createElement(
'h1',
 { className: 'header' }
);
render(
 reactElement,
 document.getElementById('react-application')
);
```

First of all, you need the latest version of a modern web browser, such as Google
Chrome or Mozilla Firefox:
* Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser
* Mozilla Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
Second, you will need to install Git, Node.js, and npm. You will find detailed instructions on how to install and use them in Chapter 2, Installing Powerful Tools for Your Project. Finally, you will need a code editor. I recommend Sublime Text 
(http://www.sublimetext.com). Alternatively, you can use Atom (https://atom.io), Brackets (http://brackets.io), Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com), or any other editor of your choice.
